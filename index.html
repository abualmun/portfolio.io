They're strong, fast, and relentless — but you're smarter, sneakier, and lighter on your claws.\n\n## 🧠 Vector-Based Movement\n\nThe core of the game’s mechanics is built around **vector calculations**. Everything — from chasing, escaping, to collecting items — is done using custom vector math. Here are a few highlights:\n\n* 🧭 The chicken always orients to walk on a spherical terrain. Movement is handled with smooth vector-based rotation and orientation.\n* 🏃 The player's movement isn't just “left” and “right” — it's defined by movement **relative to the planet's surface**, ensuring the character stays grounded in all directions.\n* 📡 Enemies detect and pursue the player using `Vector3.MoveTowards` and awake based on a calculated radius.\n* 🧲 Collectables and enemies respond to dynamic vectors, adjusting behavior as the player moves across the globe."

                            I’m Monzir, a soon-to-be AI Engineer with a knack for solving problems across all kinds of
                            software domains. My skills aren’t built on years of repetition—they’re built on fast
                            learning, sharp thinking, and a borderline unhealthy curiosity. I thrive in team
                            environments, learn at ridiculous speed (yes, faster than you’re imagining), and love
                            turning messy ideas into working systems. If it’s broken, I’ll fix it. If it’s not, I’ll
                            probably upgrade it anyway.
