## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Train an RL agent to play RoboFly, improving performance through trial and error inside a real game engine â€” **not just a simulated environment**.

## ðŸ§  Reinforcement Learning Approach

After diving into RL, I was fascinated by the core idea:
> Let a model learn *by itself* through **rewards and punishments** in a simulated environment.
