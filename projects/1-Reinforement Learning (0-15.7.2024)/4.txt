### 🔄 Agent Workflow

1. 🔌 **Integration**: Used **socket communication** to connect a `TensorFlow` model in Python with a real-time scene in the **Godot 4.2** engine.
2. 🕹️ **Control loop**:
   - Python sends an action (e.g., flap or don't).
   - Godot executes the action and returns updated game state.
   - Agent receives rewards (surviving, scoring) or punishments (crashing).
3. ♻️ Repeat millions of times — all inside a real game, not a mock simulation.
