## ⚙️ Tools & Tech

- 🧠 TensorFlow (Python) — RL logic and training.
- 🕹️ Godot Engine 4.2 — real-time game environment.
- 🔗 Socket server — communication between agent and game.
- 🧪 Custom reward function — based on survival and score.

## 📈 Training Journey

- 🚀 Best score achieved by the trained agent: **266**
- 🧪 One early training attempt failed after **11,000+ episodes** with zero progress 😂
- 👨🏾‍🔬 Later iterations improved significantly, thanks to:
  - Better model structure
  - Smarter reward shaping
  - More optimized state information exchange

## 🤔 Lessons Learned

- Game randomness might require longer training than expected 🎲
- Socket latency could bottleneck real-time decision making 🐢
- Model design has a major impact on learning capability 🧠

## 🏁 Final Thoughts

This project was a **huge motivational boost** for my AI journey. It was challenging but so rewarding to watch a self-taught agent slowly master a game I personally enjoy (and sometimes hate 🤣). More to come, inshallah! 🙏🏾
