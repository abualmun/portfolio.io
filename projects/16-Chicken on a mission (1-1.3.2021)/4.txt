## 🎮 Game Concept

You're a determined chicken with one goal: collect all the sacks before the barbarians catch you. They're strong, fast, and relentless — but you're smarter, sneakier, and lighter on your claws.

## 🧠 Vector-Based Movement

The core of the game’s mechanics is built around **vector calculations**. Everything — from chasing, escaping, to collecting items — is done using custom vector math. Here are a few highlights:

* 🧭 The chicken always orients to walk on a spherical terrain. Movement is handled with smooth vector-based rotation and orientation.
* 🏃 The player's movement isn't just “left” and “right” — it's defined by movement **relative to the planet's surface**, ensuring the character stays grounded in all directions.
* 📡 Enemies detect and pursue the player using `Vector3.MoveTowards` and awake based on a calculated radius.
* 🧲 Collectables and enemies respond to dynamic vectors, adjusting behavior as the player moves across the globe.
