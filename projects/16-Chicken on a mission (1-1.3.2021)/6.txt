## 🐔 Player Movement

We put a lot of effort into making movement *feel right*:

* Smooth spherical gravity ensures your chicken hugs the planet surface at all times.
* Directional movement works even when the "up" vector changes — thanks to world space vector projection.
* The chicken can sprint, turn sharply, and react naturally to terrain curvature.

## 🛡️ Features

* 🪓 Barbarians with detection zones and chase logic.
* 🌍 A planet-based level that feels immersive and continuous.
