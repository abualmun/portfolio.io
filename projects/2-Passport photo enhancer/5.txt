## ðŸ§  Training Details

- **Dataset:** [Flickr-Faces-HQ (FFHQ)](https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq)
  - 70,000 high-quality face images
  - Preprocessed to simulate passport-like degradation (e.g., compression, resizing, blur)

- **Training Platform:** Google Colab
  - Used TPU/High-RAM runtime
  - Mixed precision training with PyTorch + CUDA
  - Custom augmentations and passport-style degradations applied on-the-fly

- **Loss Functions:**
  - Pixel Loss (L1)
  - Perceptual Loss (VGG-based)
  - Adversarial Loss (GAN Discriminator)
  - Identity Loss (optional; based on ArcFace embeddings)
