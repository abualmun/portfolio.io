## 🔄 Device Linking Flow

1. Client requests a new device → generates a **6-digit code**
2. Code stored temporarily in `unconnected_devices`
3. VR device sends code + serial number to `/devices/connect`
4. Server verifies and registers the device in `devices` 🚀

> ✅ **Collision Avoidance:** Auto-increments if code already exists!

## 🕹️ Session Management Flow

- Client starts a session → writes to `running_scenarios`
- Device polls `/devices/start_game` to check for updates
- Decoupled, queue-like architecture for reliable sync 📡

## 📋 Audit Logging

Every API call (success or fail) is logged in `actions_log` with:
- Client ID
- User ID
- Device ID
- Scenario ID
- Action type
- Success status
- Error message (if any)
