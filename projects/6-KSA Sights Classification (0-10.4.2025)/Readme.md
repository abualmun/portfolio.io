**🧠 AI Landmark Classifier (Back-End)**
Developed a Flask-based API that classifies images of Saudi landmarks using a fine-tuned ResNet18 deep learning model. The model identifies 14 culturally significant locations and returns their names, confidence scores, and historical descriptions for tourists. It supports base64 image input and was deployed with full CORS support for frontend integration.

**🌐 Interactive React Front-End**
Built an engaging web interface with React where users can upload or capture landmark photos to get instant predictions. The app highlights the identified landmark, confidence level, and an informative description, offering a smart and accessible tool for exploring Saudi heritage.

**📦 Full-Stack Deployment & Training Workflow**
Organized a modular project structure with separate training, back-end, and front-end directories. Included scripts for error checking, thumbnail collection, and model training for both 5 and 14 classes. Designed for easy deployment and scalability using tools like Gunicorn and requirements management via `requirements.txt`.
